Tasks
Please check the lecture 12, if you haven’t so. You will see the exercise 3, we have
developed a database to keep record of the student’s name and the midterm grade. In the
exercise, database creation and the connections are explained. Your assignment is to
connect this project with HTML files. You will basically design an interface for this project
with the required forms and form objects.
• Create a home.html file which includes a form to add new student. The user should
be able to enter the name and the midterm grade of the student and hit enter
• In the home.html file, create two buttons; List all students and List the students who
pass. If the user hits the first button, information of the all students should be
displayed in the results.html page. Likewise, if the user hits the second button,
information of those students whose grade is bigger than 85 should be displayed in
the results.html page
• In the home.html, create a textbox and a delete button. If the user hits the delete
button, it should delete the students with the id number provided in the textbox.
Bonus Point: Update the students record option
Submission
• Submit a link of the forked project in canvas.
