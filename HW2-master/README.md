Submission:
•	Submit a link of the forked project in canvas.

Homework:
In the textbook, we have an exercise called Amazerrific and in each chapter we build some part of it. In homework 2, your task is to read your textbook and apply the exercises related to Amazerrific project. You will cover Chapter 1 – 6 for this homework. 
You need to modify the project in terms of view, however you should keep the main functionalities as is. That means; you can change the colors, text, images, css… etc. You can’t change the main functionality of the application, the platforms we develop the project and store the files...etc.
Submit your project to gitlab. If you are having difficulties with the gitlab, you should review the lecture note,lab1, and git/gitlab documentations.
Good Luck 
