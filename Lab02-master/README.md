Designing a simple and scientific calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Design a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Use CSS (or bootstrap, jquery..etc libraries) to implement fancy buttons and text. You can check the lecture 4 to learn about these libraries.

A simple calculator should display four functions:

a) Addition of two numbers
b) Subtraction of two numbers
c) Multiplication of two numbers, and
d) Division of two numbers


Please extend the simple calculator to a scientific calculator implementing two or more functions such as a) calculating the square root of a number b) calculating sin, cos and tan functions, c) calculating power of a number.


Design the codes and submit them on GitLab along with proper outputs. You can also take screenshots for input and output and submit them on GitLab. Below is the link to view our group and upload the codes there.

Important Notes:


1. This exercise contains bonus points. You are supposed to submit the codes on GitLab within a week. Due date for submitting this is June 19, 2019. Bonus points will be added to your final homework grades.

2. You can browse the web for looking into different tutorials of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can also check YouTube tutorials for this exercise. However, you can’t copy the code entirely as per UAB’s academic dishonesty policy. You need to come up with your own code.

3. Please make sure you attach or provide references for the codes you have come up with in this lab.
